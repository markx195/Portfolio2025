## How It All Began

My journey into coding started in university where I studied Computer Science. C++ was my first language, and while I appreciated its power, it wasn’t until I began experimenting with web development that I truly found my calling. The turning point came when I started creating websites that fused my love for anime with sleek, modern designs. The idea of blending my interests with my skills was both exciting and fulfilling.

## The Spark of Passion

It was during this exploration of web design that I realized how much I loved the creative process. I experimented with anime-inspired motion effects, incorporating elements like dynamic transitions and interactive features. This fusion of technology and design felt like a natural extension of my interests, and I quickly became enamored with the art of crafting beautiful, functional websites.

## Boot Camp Triumphs

Eager to further my skills, I applied for a coding boot camp. It was there that I had my first major breakthrough. I led a project for a hackathon that involved creating a movie review platform, somewhat akin to Netflix. Our project not only won first prize but also reinforced my passion for front-end development. The experience was exhilarating and validated my decision to pursue this path.

## A Close Second

The following year, I participated in another hackathon with a project focused on video calling. Although we didn’t take first place, securing second rank was a testament to the progress I had made and the impact of our innovative approach. These experiences were instrumental in shaping my career and pushing me to refine my skills.

## Diving into the Industry

With a solid foundation and a clear vision, I transitioned into professional work, where I could continue to explore and create. My career has allowed me to immerse myself in design and development, where I constantly find joy in the creative process. Each project is a new opportunity to blend aesthetics with functionality, bringing my unique vision to life.

## Looking Ahead

As I continue to work in the field, I remain dedicated to evolving my skills and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in web design. The journey from C++ to front-end development has been a thrilling adventure, one that I’m excited to continue. Designing and creating remains at the heart of what I do, and I look forward to the future with enthusiasm and anticipation.
